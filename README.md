# pw-test

This is a little tool to compare a password and the hash generated by the `pw` utility from [mosquitto-go-auth](https://github.com/iegomez/mosquitto-go-auth).

## Build

Just run `go build` to generate the `pw-test` binary.

## Usage

```
Usage of ./pw-test:
  -h string
    	pbkdf2 password hash. use single quotes so $ symbols aren't taken as variables
  -p string
    	plain text password
```
